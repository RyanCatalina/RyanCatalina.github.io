# Lesson65 A famous actress

The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear.

不自律的人生，就是被人生反复的羞辱。
但你一件事每天都去做，坚持十年，必定会成为这件事的行家。

The limits of your language are the limits of your world.

操千曲而后晓声，观千剑而后识器。

黑客技术学的再好，也无法入侵你的心！
服务器入侵的再多，对你也只有Guest！
你总有防火墙，我始终停不掉！
没有任何奢求只想做你最后的Administrator！

不要试图与蠢人讲道理，它们是不会听得懂的。
这是浪费自己的精力以及时间。
因为会是自己心烦，所以浪费时间。

一个人总要走陌生的路，看陌生的风景，听陌生的歌，然后在某个不经意的瞬间，你会发现，原本是费劲心机想要忘记的事情真的就那么忘记了。

不经一番寒彻骨，怎得梅花扑鼻香。

# Review

1. must / have to / needn't 的用法
    must 和have to ：必须、应该
    must 主观看法。说法的这个人，他自己觉得应该，发自内心的一种看法。
    have to 客观。由外界环境所压迫，逼迫；不得不做某事；可能心里并不情愿。

    当把must的句子变成否定的时候，使用needn't

    / I don't need to go home now. (我不是非得现在就要回家。)

2. What a nuisance! 真讨厌！真麻烦！
    What 引导的感叹句
    以后的学习中我们还会学到用疑问词How来引导的感叹句

# Listening

Today's dialogue is about a famous actress.

Question:

answer:

        probably adv.大概，可能

text:
    Can you recognize that woman, Liz?
    I think I can, Kate. It must be Karen Marsh, the actress.
    I though so. Who's that beside her?
    That must be Conrad Reeves.

    Conrad Reeves, the actor?
    It's can't be. Let me have another look.
    I think you're right!
    Isn't he her third husband?
    No, He must be her fourth or fifth.

    Doesn't Karen Marsh look old!
    She does, doesn't she! I read she's twenty-nine, but she must be at least forty.
    I'm sure she is.

    She was a famous actress when I was still at school.
    That was a long time ago wasn't it?
    Not that long ago! I'm not more than twenty-nine myself.

# Language Points

Can you recognize that woman, Liz?
    recognize v.认出，辨别
I think I can, Kate. It must be Karen Marsh, the actress.
    I think I can 属于省略句。
    -> I think I can recognize her.
    Do you think you can pass the exam?
    I think I can. 我觉得我能...(通过考试)
    Can you climb up the tree?
    I think I can. 我觉得我行...(爬上那棵树)

    the actress 做Karen Marsh这样一个名词的同位语。
    must be 是英语中用来表示推断的一种方式。而且用在肯定的推断，有一定事实依据。经常翻译成：一定...，肯定...
I though so. Who's that beside her?
    beside prep.在...旁边
    I think so. 在英语中表示同意，很多情况下，都用这个句子。
    表达不同意：I don't think so. (否定前置的现象)
    例外：hope -> 希望如此：I hope so.
               -> 我不希望这样：I hope not.
That must be Conrad Reeves.

Conrad Reeves, the actor?
It's can't be. 
    It can't be. 表示英语中的否定推断，也可以认为是must be的否定形式。
    It can't be. = It can't be Conrad Reeves.
    can 表示能力，可以做某事
    can't 能力达不到，不能达到
    I can swim.
    He can't swim.
    *今天这节课出现的can't be 是和must be 相对应的。跟推测有关，一个肯定，一个否定。

    exercise:
        A: I think she's Danish.(Swedish 瑞典人)
        B: I don't think so. She can't be Danish. She must be Swedish.
        B的回答中，先否定了A的推测，又接着给出了另一个自己的肯定语气的推测。
Let me have another look.
I think you're right!
Isn't he her third husband? 难道他不是她第三任丈夫吗？
No, He must be her fourth or fifth.

Doesn't Karen Marsh look old!
She does, doesn't she! I read she's twenty-nine, but she must be at least forty.
    at least 至少
    I can run al least 400 meters every day.
    He is at least 190 centimeters.
I'm sure she is.

    刚才出现了两个反问语气的句子：
    1.Isn't he her third husband? 难道他不是她第三任丈夫吗？
    2.Doesn't Karen Marsh look old! Karen Marsh看起来真老！真够老的！
    rhetorical question: 为了强调语气和效果的反问。前面是否定含义的词来开头，反问的语气很明显，相当于“难道...”

She was a famous actress when I was still at school.
    at school 还在上学的时候
That was a long time ago, wasn't it?
    ago 用在一般过去时里面很常见。前面加一个时间段，表示多久多久以前。
    Long Long ago, ...
    童话的结尾：They live a happy life every after.
    
    反义疑问句：
        最明显的特点：前面如果是肯定，后面就是否定；前面如果是否定，后面就是肯定。
        构成：都是前面是陈述句，后面是疑问句。
        1. 陈述部分<肯定> + 疑问部分<否定>
            He is tall, isn't he?
        2. 陈述部分<否定> + 疑问部分<肯定>
            He isn't tall, is he?
            She studies hard, doesn't she?
            They study hard, don't they?
        注意：如果前面陈述的部分没有be动词，那我们后半部分提问的时候需要加上助动词。前后时态要保持一致。

        举几个反例：
            She was a student, isn't she? 错误
            -> She was a student, wasn't she?
            ->/ She is a student, isn't she?
            She sings well, isn't she? 错误
            -> She sings well, doesn't she?
        
        回答：如果是真实的，就回答Yes, ...
            如果是不真实，就回答No, ...
            注意yes和no都需要和后面的内容保持一致。

            She isn't a student, is she?
            事实的真相是：她确实不是学生。
            -> No, she isn't. *No和isn't都是否定语气，语气一致。
            我们可以说：Yes, she is. / No, she isn't.

            He works hard, doesn't he? 他工作很努力，不是吗？
            -> Yes, he does. / No, he doesn't.
            *Think in English 学会用英语思维方式
Not that long ago!
    也没有那么久!
    that adv.表示“那么、那样”
    She's not that tall.
    I can't jump that far.
I'm not more than twenty-nine myself.

# Review

1. 英语中是如何表示对现在状况的推断的？
    肯定：must be ... 一定
    否定：can't be ... 不可能
    She must be at least forty.
    She can't be. She is still young.

2. 两个反问句<rhetorical question> & 反义疑问句
    Isn't he her third husband?
    Doesn't Karen Marsh look old?

    反义疑问句，要强调的是：
        1.前肯定，后否定；前否定，后肯定
        2.时态要保持一致
        3.前面陈述部分有be动词，那么后面提问的时候就用be动词；
          前面陈述部分没有be动词，那么后面提问需要加上助动词才可以。
        4.回答的时候千万不能根据中文思维，要根据事实情况：
            如果是肯定的真相，就Yes, + 肯定回答
            如果是否定的情况，就是No + 否定回答

3. that 作副词出现
    She's not that tall.
