# Review4

The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear.

不自律的人生，就是被人生反复的羞辱。
但一件事每天都去做，坚持十年，必定会发生质变，你将成为你所在领域里的行家。

The limits of your language are the limits of your world.

操千曲而后晓声，观千剑🗡而后识器。

黑客技术学的再好，也无法入侵你的心！
服务器入侵的再多，对你也只有Guest！
你总有防火墙，我始终停不掉！
没有任何奢求只想做你最后的Administrator！

不要试图与蠢人讲道理，它们是不会听得懂的，而且这样是浪费双方的时间以及精力。

一个人总要走陌生的路，看陌生的风景，听陌生的歌，然后在某个不经意的瞬间，你会发现，原本是费劲心机想要忘记的事情真的就那么忘记了。

不经一番寒彻骨，怎得梅花扑鼻香。

这种事情见得多了，我只想说懂得都懂，不懂的我也不多解释，毕竟自己知道就好，细细品吧。你们也别来问我怎么了，利益牵扯太大，说了对你我都没好处，当不知道就行了，其余的我只能说这里面水很深，牵扯到很多东西。详细情况你们自己是很难找的，网上大部分已经删除干净了，所以我只能说懂得都懂。
This kind of thing see many, I just want to say understand all understand, don't understand I also don't explain much, after all oneself know good, careful taste. You also don't come to ask me how, the interest involved too big, said to you I have no benefit, when don't know to go, the rest of me can only say this inside water deep, involve a lot of things. It is difficult to find the detailed information by yourselves. Most of the Internet has been deleted, so I can only say that I understand everything

课前一定要预习
今日事今日毕：
    Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.
心情愉快地去学习。

4. 间接引语的时态迁移现象

    [She said] she was not going to make another.
    [She said] she was going to retire.
    [She told reporters] she felt very tired and didn't want to make another film for a long time.
    -> tell sth. to me 或 tell sb. sth.
    *当主句是过去时态，直接引语变间接引语：
        1.从句：一般现在时 -> 一般过去时
        2.从句：现在完成时 -> 过去完成时。
        3.从句：一般将来时 -> 过去将来时。（不常见）

-> 如果A发生了，那么B...
    If I have a lot of money, I will travel round the world first.
        travel round = travel around
    
    常考点：主将从现
        如果条件状语从句用于询问或者谈论十分可能发生的事情，那么条件状语从句中常用一般现在时；而主句则用一般将来时。
        If it rains tomorrow, we won't go out then.

6. 被动语态(Passive Voice)
    何时使用？
    -> 不想突出句子的主语
    -> 或者想用含糊不清的词来表达主语（someone, somebody）
    -> 不知道具体发出这个动作的是谁
    构成：相应的be动词 + 过去分词来组成
    *相应的be动词：主语是否一致，还要考虑时态
    I was invited to her wedding.
        be invied to ... 被邀请
    *如果一定要表明动作发出者的话，可以用介词by
        I was invited to her wedding by her father.
    *被动语态：客观
