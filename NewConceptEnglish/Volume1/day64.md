# Lesson66 Tea for two

The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear.

不自律的人生，就是被人生反复的羞辱。
但你一件事每天都去做，坚持十年，必定会成为这件事的行家。

The limits of your language are the limits of your world.

操千曲而后晓声，观千剑而后识器。

黑客技术学的再好，也无法入侵你的心！
服务器入侵的再多，对你也只有Guest！
你总有防火墙，我始终停不掉！
没有任何奢求只想做你最后的Administrator！

不要试图与蠢人讲道理，它们是不会听得懂的。
这是浪费自己的精力以及时间。
因为会是自己心烦，所以浪费时间。

一个人总要走陌生的路，看陌生的风景，听陌生的歌，然后在某个不经意的瞬间，你会发现，原本是费劲心机想要忘记的事情真的就那么忘记了。

不经一番寒彻骨，怎得梅花扑鼻香。

# Reviewe

1. 关于must / have to / needn't
    must / have to : 必须，应该...
    在英语使用的时候，还是有些区别的。
    must 必须，主观看法。自己内心觉得需要。
    have to 不得不，更多是外界环境的作用

    I must go home now.
    变成疑问句：Must I go home now?
    变成否定句：I don't need to go home now.
                / I needn't go home now.
            
    I have to go home now.
    变成疑问句：Do I have to go home now?
    变成否定句：I don't have to go home now.

2.  What a nuisance! (感叹句)真讨厌，真麻烦
