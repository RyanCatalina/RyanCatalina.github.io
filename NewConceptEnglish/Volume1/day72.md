# Lesson72 Sally's first train ride

The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear.

不自律的人生，就是被人生反复的羞辱。
但你一件事每天都去做，坚持十年，必定会成为这件事的行家。

The limits of your language are the limits of your world.

操千曲而后晓声，观千剑而后识器。

黑客技术学的再好，也无法入侵你的心！
服务器入侵的再多，对你也只有Guest！
你总有防火墙，我始终停不掉！
没有任何奢求只想做你最后的Administrator！

不要试图与蠢人讲道理，它们是不会听得懂的。
这是浪费自己的精力以及时间。
因为会是自己心烦，所以浪费时间。

一个人总要走陌生的路，看陌生的风景，听陌生的歌，然后在某个不经意的瞬间，你会发现，原本是费劲心机想要忘记的事情真的就那么忘记了。

不经一番寒彻骨，怎得梅花扑鼻香。

question:
    Why was the mother embarrassed?
answer:
    Because Sally told the middle-aged lady she was ugly.

text:
    Last week, my four-year-old daughter,  Sally was invited to a children's party.
    I decided to take her by train.
    Sally was very excited because she had never travelled on a train before.
   
    She sat near the window and asked questions about everything she saw.
    Suddenly, a middle-aged lady got on the train and sat opposite Sally.
    "Hello, little girl," She said.

    Sally did now answer, but looked at her curiously.
    The lady was dressed in a blue coat and a large, funny hat.

    After the train had left the station, the lady opened her handbag and took out her powder compact.
    She then began to make up her face.

    "Why are you doing that?" Sally asked.
    "To make myself beautiful." The lady answered.
    She put away her compact and smiled kindly.
    "But you are still ugly," Sally said.
    Sally was amused, but I was very embarrassed.
