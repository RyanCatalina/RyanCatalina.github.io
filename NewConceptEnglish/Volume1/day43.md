# Lesson42 Going on holiday

The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear.

不自律的人生，就是被人生反复的羞辱。
但你一件事每天都去做，坚持十年，必定会成为这件事的行家。

The limits of your language are the limits of your world.

# Language Points

Hello, Sam. Come in.
Hi, Sam. We're having lunch.
Do you want to have lunch with us?
No, thank you. Tom. I've already had lunch.
I had lunch at half past twelve.

Have a cup of coffee then.
I've just had a cup, thank you.
    1. I've already had lunch.
    2. I've just had a cup.
        've 助动词have 的缩写
        already 一般出现在助动词后面
        have 作动词，表示拥有
        do 助动词 -> does/did
    现在完成时的结构：主语 + have 的现在式 + 过去分词
    *如果主语是单数第三人称，have需变成has
    过去分词：规则动词同过去式
            不规则动词：需单独记忆
    关于动词的思考：
        它的过去式（its past tense form）是什么？
        它的过去分词（its past participle form）又是什么？
    一般现在时：表示习惯性的，一般性的动作
    一般过去时：表示发生在过去的动作
    the present perfect 现在完成时，适用于两种情况：
        1. 在过去某个时间内发生一个动作，并且对现在产生影响，或者说，跟现在有着某种联系。
        2. 表示过去就开始了的一个动作一直，持续，持续，直到现在。
    1. I've already had lunch.
    -> 我已经吃过了我的午饭，对现在的影响，就是我就不需要和你们一起吃了。
    2. I've just had a cup.
    -> 正因为我刚刚才喝完了一杯，所以，我这会儿不喝了。表示对现在的一个影响。
    already & just 强调已经完成，和刚刚做完，刚刚发生
    例子：  
        1. Have some coffee.
        I've already had some coffee. / I have had some. / I've had some.
        some 代词，指代some coffee
        2. Have a banana.
        I have already had one.
        / I've already had one.
        one 指代a banana
I had one after my lunch.

Let's go into the living room, Carol.
    let's do sth 让我们一起做某事
    Let's run to the park.
We can have our coffee there.
    there 指示代词，指代living room
Excuse the mess, Sam. This room's very untidy. We're packing our suitcases.

We're going to leave tomorrow. Tom and I are going to have a holiday.

Aren't you lucky!
    -> 否定疑问句的感叹句形式！
    Lesson34 
        Mrs. Williams : Aren't you lucky!
            ->形式上否定，但表示强有力的肯定
    Can't you wait till this afternoon?
        -> 否定疑问句
When are you going to have a holiday, Sam?
I don't know.
I've already had my holiday this year.
    现在完成时的提问：
    Have you had your holiday this year? 你今年度过假了吗？
    回答：Yes, I have. / No, I haven't.
    练习：
        1. Have you had any apples or peaches? 你吃了一些苹果还是一些桃子？
            -> I haven't had any apples. I've just had some peaches. 我没吃苹果，我吃了几个桃子。
        2. 第三人称。助动词要相应地变化。
            Has he had any tomatoes or potatoes? 他吃了番茄还是土豆呢？
            -> He hasn't had any tomatoes. He has just had some potatoes./He's just had some potatoes. 他没吃番茄，但是吃了几个土豆。
        3. 复数人称。they 他们
            Have they had any tea or coffee? 他们喝了茶或者咖啡吗？
