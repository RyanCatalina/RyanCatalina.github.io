# Lesson59 Knock, knock!

The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear.

不自律的人生，就是被人生反复的羞辱。
但你一件事每天都去做，坚持十年，必定会成为这件事的行家。

The limits of your language are the limits of your world.

操千曲而后晓声，观千剑而后识器。

黑客技术学的再好，也无法入侵你的心！
服务器入侵的再多，对你也只有Guest！
你总有防火墙，我始终停不掉！
没有任何奢求只想做你最后的Administrator！

不要试图与蠢人讲道理，它们是不会听得懂的。
这是浪费自己的精力以及时间。
因为会是自己心烦，所以浪费时间。

    I don't like spicy food at all.

    anyone, everything, anything, nothing由some,any,no,every后面加one,thing构成的复合词，经常被称作不定代词。因为不确定所指的是什么、是谁，所以被称作是不定代词。
    Every       None        Any         Some
    Everyone    No one      Anyone      Someone
    Everybody   Nobody      Anybody     Somebody
    Everything  Nothing     Anything    Something
    Everywhere  Nowhere     Anywhere    Somewhere

    something,anything,nothing
    1) something放在疑问句中->anything (some -> any)
        There is something wrong with my washing machine.
        -> Is there anything wrong with your washing machine?
    2) something放在否定句中->anything, nothing
        nothing 什么都没有
        anything 任何东西
        nothing = 否定含义的anything
        I didn't buy anything.
        -> I bought nothing.
    记住：1) 前面出现否定词not，后面就用anything；
            前面没有出现否定词，就用nothing。
            I didn't buy nothing. 双重否定
        2) 如果前面是否定，用助动词do
            I didn't buy anything. -> I bought nothing.
            I didn't see anyone.
            -> I saw no one / nobody.

Let's try the back door.
Look! Everyone's in the garden.
    We have two pens. This one is broken. Let's try that one.
    This one is not working. Let's try that one.
    Everyone 每个人
Hello, Helen. Hello, Jim.
Everybody wants to have lunch in the garden.
    Everybody 和everyone 都可以表达“每一个人”，它们作主语的时候，谓语动词需要用单数。
    -> They are all in the garden.
        We all want to have lunch in the garden.
It's nice and warm out here.

Come and have something to drink.
    something 某事，某物
    have sth. to drink 喝点东西 = drink sth.
    have sth. to eat 吃点东西 = eat sth.
Thanks, Carol. May I have a glass of beer please?
    May I ... 正式的说法，和Could I ... 一样，都很委婉，很正式。
    May I borrow your pen?
    May I use your mobile phone?

Beer? There's none left. You can have some lemonade.
Lemonade!
Don't believe her, Jim. She's only joking.
Have some beer!
    have = drink.
    喝点啤酒吧！

    exercise:
        1. They're all watching television.
            everyone 做主语
        -> Everyone's watching television.
        2. Everyone's looking out of the window.
        -> They're all looking out of the window.
            all 一般都是配合复数主语出现的
