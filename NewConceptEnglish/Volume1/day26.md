This lamb's very good.
    very good 非常好
    This pen's very good.
    This dress is very good.
I like lamb, but my husband doesn't.
    doesn't 单数第三人称
    完整：I like lamb, but my husband doesn't like lamb.
    do 起助动词的作用。协助主要动词的作用。
    does do的单数第三人称形式
    当主语是第三人称，并且是单数的时候，需要用动词的单数第三人称
    I like green.
    He likes green.
    第三人称有他、她、它，he属于第三人称单数，like变成likes。
    一般动词后面加s,或者es变成单数第三人称形式。
    I want a cup of tea.
    She wants a cup of tea.
    She 第三人称单数 want -> wants
    I sing a song.
    He sings a song.
    I run.
    The dog runs.
    如果是否定语气，怎么表达？
    实义动词来做谓语动词，应根据主语来加助动词，然后在后面跟上动词原形。
    I like green. -> I don't like green.
    He likes green. -> He doesn't like green.
    I want a cup of tea. -> I don't want a cup of tea.
    She wants a cup of tea. -> She doesn't want a cup of tea.
    如果是疑问的语气，怎么表达？
    Do you like coffee?
    Yes, I do. / Yes, I like coffee.
    Does she like coffee?
    Yes, she does. / Yes, she likes coffee.
    Does he want a new schoolbag?
    No, he doesn't. / No, he doesn't want a new schoolbag.

    小结：主语是单数第三人称<he /  she / it>时，如果想用do提问，要变成do的单数第三人称形式does。
    用do进行省略回答时：
    肯定语气：用动词do代替其他实义动词，单数第三人称为主语时，把do变成does。
    He / She / It does.
    否定语气：doesn't + 实义动词原形。
    doesn't like / want

    do可以替代其他实义动词，作为省略用法。除此之外还有：
    1.be动词
        He is eating some bread, but she ____.
        他正在吃面包，但是她没在吃。
        现在进行时，be动词+现在分词。-> 应该用be动词来省略
        后半句主语是she，相应的be动词是is，否定形式：isn't
        -> He is eating some bread, but she isn't.
        She isn' = She isn't eating any bread.
        They are working hard, but we ___.
        他们正在努力工作，但是我们不是。
        现在进行时。后半句主语是we，相应的be动词是are
        are的否定形式->aren't
        -> They are working hard, but we aren't.
    2.情态动词(can)
        must: 必须 -> What must I do?
        can: 能，表示一种能力
        She can type very well, but he ___.
        can -> cannot/can't 
        -> She can type very well, but he can't.
        -> She can type very well, but they can't.
        can: 省略表达不用看主语。
    小结：三种省略的情况中，用be动词，用do来省略表达，都需要看主语人称来做一定的变化。情态动词，不用看主语人称。
What about some steak? This is a nice piece.
    what about 提议，干什么...怎么样？
    steak 不可数名词，牛排
    This is a nice piece. -> This is a nice piece of steak.
Give me that piece, please.
    另一种说法：Give that piece to me, please.
And a pound of mince, too.
    mince 肉馅，碎肉，包饺子，做馅饼用的那种

Do you want a chicken, Mrs. Bird? They'ra very nice.
    very nice = very good
No, thank you.
My husband like steak, but he doesn't like chicken.
    my husband 相当于he, 单数第三人称。所以like -> likes
    否定doesn't like
    使用句型：Do you like ...
            Yes, I do. I like ... but I don't want ...
        Do you like grapes?
        Yes, I do. I like grapes, but I don't want one/any.
        Does Sam like lettuce? lettuce 莴苣，生菜
        Yes, he does. He likes lettuce, but he doesn't want any.
        Does Elizabeth like pears?
        Yes, she does. She likes pears, but she doesn't want one/any.
To tell you the truth, Mrs. Bird, I don't like chicken either!
    to tell you the truth 告诉你实话吧
    to be honest/frank 
    honest/frank 诚实，坦诚
    either 表示...也
    和之前学过的too不同：too 出现在肯定句中，either出现在否定句中。
    I like dogs. My brother likes dogs, too.
    I don't like dogs. My brother doesn't like dogs, either.
