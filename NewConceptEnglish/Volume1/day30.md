# Vocabulay

foot n.脚，足
    It's easier to get there on foot than by car.
        ”It's easier to get there on foot than by car. ”的翻译是“到那儿去，步行比坐车容易。”我们来分析一下英文：
        这句英文里，it是形式主语，指代的就是get there（到那儿去）。
        easier 是easy的比较级，表示 更容易。
        on foot(步行，走路去)、by car(坐车，坐车去），这是表达交通出行的固定短语。
        than表示前后两者比较，所以是on foot  和 by car比，easier后面跟的是on foot，所以on foot比by car更容易。
        所以这句话翻译出来就是到那儿去，步行比坐车容易。”
    on foot 步行，走路去
    by car 方式状语，坐小汽车去

    football 足球
        ball n.球
        foot 复数特殊 -> feet

    hand 手
        handbag
    arm 胳膊

# Language Points

It is eight o'clock.
    问时间的时候，我们可以用it：
    -> What time is it?
    表示天气也用it：
    -> It's sunny. / It snows.
    在英语中it十分常见，也被称作虚主语。
        What time is it?
    整点时间的表达，用阿拉伯数字的英文说法加上o'clock
    6点 six o'clock
    10点 ten o'clock
    强调整点时刻：加上sharp
    It's ten o'clock sharp.
    在英语中用a.m.表示早上、上午；而用p.m.表示下午，晚上。
    他们的分界线就是noon，中文十二点。
        It's six o'clock a.m.
        It's six o'clock p.m.
    注意：a.m. 和p.m. 书写的时候，一定不能忘记这两个点
