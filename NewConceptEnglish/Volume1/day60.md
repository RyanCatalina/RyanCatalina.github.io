# Lesson60 Tommy's breakfast

The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear.

不自律的人生，就是被人生反复的羞辱。
但你一件事每天都去做，坚持十年，必定会成为这件事的行家。

The limits of your language are the limits of your world.

操千曲而后晓声，观千剑而后识器。

黑客技术学的再好，也无法入侵你的心！
服务器入侵的再多，对你也只有Guest！
你总有防火墙，我始终停不掉！
没有任何奢求只想做你最后的Administrator！

不要试图与蠢人讲道理，它们是不会听得懂的。
这是浪费自己的精力以及时间。
因为会是自己心烦，所以浪费时间。

一个人总要走陌生的路，看陌生的风景，听陌生的歌，然后在某个不经意的瞬间，你会发现，原本是费劲心机想要忘记的事情真的就那么忘记了。

# Language Points

When my husband was going into dining room this morning, he dropped some coins on the floor.
    into 强调动作发生的过程，从没有进饭厅，到进饭厅
    on the floor 在地板上
    drop 掉落，落下
    过去进行时
        现在进行时：表示说话的时候，正在进行、正在发生的动作。
        过去进行时：只是把这样一个时间轴向过去推了一下而已。表示在过去的某事某刻，正在进行、正在发生的动作。
            昨天的下午14:00，我正在图书馆看书。这表示，昨天下午那个时间，我正在做的事情。用现在进行时，不合适。这种情况下，要用到过去进行时。
        过去进行时怎么构成的？
            与现在进行时相比过去进行时的区别，主要在于be动词的过去式。
            现在进行时：主语 + be动词的现在时 + 动词的现在分词
                She is sitting under the tree. 她正坐在树下。
                We are having our lunch. 我们正在吃午饭。
            我们换成过去进行时
                She was sitting under the tree. 她当时坐在树下
                We were having our lunch. 我们当时正在吃午饭。
                注意：这里be动词的选用，需要配合句子的主语。
                    he -> is -> was
                    we -> are -> were
    When my husband was going into the dining room:表示时间的时间状语；用了过去进行时，是一个持续性的动作。
    he dropped some coins on the floor: 掉硬币，是一个瞬间性的动作。
    -> When A was doing sth., B did sth. : 当A正在做某事的时候，B做了某事。
    * 时间都发生在过去
There were coins everywhere.
We looked for them, but we could not find them all.
    were are的过去式
    everywhere adv.到处都是
    I looked everywhere, but I still couldn't find him. 我找遍了所有地方，但是还是找不到他。
    couldn't could not的缩写
    could can的过去式
    all 用来强调“每一个”硬币，“所有”硬币
    Grammatically, 从语法上说，all 是them的同位语。
    同位语：紧紧跟在一个名词/代词的后面，进一步说明前面这个名词/代词。
    We Chinese are proud of our country. 我们中国人，为我们的祖国感到骄傲。
        实际上，Chinese就是we的同位语。
    Mr. Smith, our new teacher, is very kind to us.
        Smith 先生，我们的新老师，对我们非常友好。
        our new teacher就是Mr. Smith的同位语。其实说的是一个人。
    My little dog Dobby is sick. I feel sad.
        我的小狗Dobby 生病了，我觉得很难过。

        所指是同一个事物，或者同一个人物。
        完全可以等同，这种情况下，是同位语。

        He arrived. I had a bath.
