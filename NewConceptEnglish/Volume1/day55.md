# Lesson55 It's too small

The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear.

不自律的人生，就是被人生反复的羞辱。
但你一件事每天都去做，坚持十年，必定会成为这件事的行家。

The limits of your language are the limits of your world.

操千曲而后晓声，观千剑而后识器。

黑客技术学的再好，也无法入侵你的心！
服务器入侵的再多，对你也只有Guest！
你总有防火墙，我始终停不掉！
没有任何奢求只想做你最后的Administrator！

text:
    Do you like this dress, madam?
    I like the colour very much. It's a lovely dress, but it's too small for me.
    What about this one? It's a lovely dress.

    It's very smart. Short skirts are in fashion now. Would you like to try it?
    All right.

    I'm afraid this green dress is too small for me as well. It's smaller than the blue one.
    I don't like the colour either. It doesn't suit me at all. I think the blue dress is prettier.

    Could you show me another blue dress?
    I want a dress like that one, but it must be my size.
    I'm afraid I haven't got a larger dress.
    This is the largest dress in the shop.

    as well 也
    too & as well
        too:
            1.一般出现在句尾，而且too前面经常还有一个逗号。
            2.只能用在肯定句里面。如果否定的话，就要换成either
                I love cars, and he loves cars, too.
            3.可以紧紧贴着主语，前后用逗号隔开。
                I, too, know her telephone number.<以示强调>
                正常语序：I know her telephone number too.
        as well:
            不能紧贴主语表示强调
            1.通常也放在句尾
            2.一般也只在肯定句中出现
                She not only sings, she plays the piano as well.
            3.含义理解起来更多样化
                Helen plays the piano as well.
                比如有以下几种理解：
                1.其他人弹琴，Helen也弹
                -> Tom plays the piano. Helen plays the piano as well.
                2.Helen 不光会弹琴，还会拉小提琴
                -> Helen plays the violin. Helen plays the piano as well.
    
    It's smaller than the blue one.
    比较级：在英语中，当我们把一个人，或者物体，跟另外一个人，或者物体相比较的时候，就需要用到形容词的比较级。
        1.大多数情况：在原来的说法后面加上er，本身以e结尾，直接加r
            small -> smaller
            large -> larger
        2.有些以y结尾的双音节形容词
        如果y前面是一个辅音字母，变比较级y->i，然后再加er
            pretty -> prettier
    than 句子中提到了对比双方，要在比较级后面加上than
        It's smaller than the blue one.
    如果句子中形容词指的比较清楚，比较级也可以独立存在。独立存在是需要有语境<context>的。
        I haven't got a larger apple.
    练习：把形容词变成它们的比较级
        It is warm today, but it was warmer yesterday.
            warm -> warmer


All right.

I'm afraid this green dress is too small for me as well. It's smaller than the blue one.
I don't like the colour either. It doesn't suit me at all. I think the blue dress is prettier.
    at all 根本不...一点也不...

Could you show me another blue dress?
I want a dress like that one, but it must be my size.
I'm afraid I haven't got a larger dress.
This is the largest dress in the shop.
    I'm afraid ... 委婉一些，恐怕...

    形容词的最高级：在形容词原级后面加上est，在最高级形容词之前加上定冠词the。
    最高级通常是一个东西和多个东西比较，或者一个人和多个人比较。经常指明是在某一个范围内加以比较。
        He is the tallest in our class.
        This is the largest dress in the shop.
    形容词最高级前一定要用the

    练习：
        This policeman is tall.
        -> But that policeman is taller.
           He is the tallest policeman I have ever seen.
           I have ever seen 我所见过的...
