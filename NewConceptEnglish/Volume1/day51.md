d# Lesson51 Ow!

The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear.

不自律的人生，就是被人生反复的羞辱。
但你一件事每天都去做，坚持十年，必定会成为这件事的行家。

The limits of your language are the limits of your world.

操千曲而后晓声，观千剑而后识器。

黑客技术学的再好，也无法入侵你的心！
服务器入侵的再多，对你也只有Guest！
你总有防火墙，我始终停不掉！
没有任何奢求只想做你最后的Administrator！

# Review

1. 名词性物主代词，充当名词用，后面没有名词
    There are two pencils. One is blue and one is red.
    The red one is yours and the blue one is mine.

2. Belong to
    The red one belongs to you and the blue one belongs to me.

# Language Points

Ow!
    表示夸张的声音，“哎哟！”=Ouch!
    Ow! I cut my finger! / Ouch! I cut my finger!
What's the matter, Andy?
I slipped and fell downstairs.
    slip 双写最后一个字母
    以重读闭音节结尾，末尾只有一个辅音字母的词要双写：现在分词ing & 过去分词
    sit->sitting
    begin->beginning
    put->putting
    swim->swimming

Have you hurt yourself?
Yes, I have. 
I think that I've hurt my back.
    I've hurt my back. ->小句子
    I think that ... 我觉得，我想，我认为
    that 做引导词，后面加上小句子，属于宾语从句。    
Try and stand up.
    在英语中，用and 把两个动词排列在一起：
        Come upstairs and see it.
    常常用来鼓励某种动作
        Watch and learn.
            I failed again.
            What? Again? Watch and learn.
Can you stand up?
Here. Let me help you.
    Here. 用在感叹词，表示“来”“喂”引起别人注意
    Here! What are you doing?
    Helen!
    Here!
    there 也有类似用法
    There, there, don't cry.
    动词不定式：... to do 
    to give / to sleep / to watch / to see
    不带to只出现后面的动词：感官动词和使役动词省略to
        see sb. do sth.
        watch sb. do sth.
        have sb. do sth.
    感官动词：see / watch / notice / observe(观察到) / look at / hear / listen to / feel
    使役动词：let / have / make
I'm sorry, Lucy. 
I'm afraid that I can't get up.
    get up 起床，站起来
    He got up from the floor and said hello to me.

I think that the doctor had better see you.
    I think that 我认为... -> 引导主观看法
    phone v.打电话 = call -> I'll call Dr. Carter.
I'll phone Dr. Carter.
The doctor says that he will come at once.
    at once 立刻，马上，很快就来
    直接引语：直接加引号，把别人说的话原封不动拿过来，放在引号里面
    间接引语：把某一个所说的话另一个人。不用引号。往往会在引用的话之前，加上that这样的词引导
    变间接宾语要注意：人称、句子时态、时间状语
    
    练习：
        1.He is drinking his milk.
        ->He says that he is drinking his milk.

        2.She has found her pen. 
        ->She says that she has found her pen.

        从句是一个现在完成时，由前面主语是She says ... 所以后面从句时态就不变了，照搬过来。

        3.She doesn't speak English.
        ->She says that she doesn't speak English.

        4.What's the matter with him?(feel/tired)
        He says that he feels tired.

        5.What do they want?(some / money)
        They say that they want some money.
