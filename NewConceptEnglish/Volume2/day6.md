# Lesson 05 No wrong numbers

The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear.

不自律的人生，就是被人生反复的羞辱。
但一件事每天都去做，坚持十年，必定会发生质变，你将成为你所在领域里的行家。

The limits of your language are the limits of your world.

操千曲而后晓声，观千剑🗡而后识器。

黑客技术学的再好，也无法入侵你的心！
服务器入侵的再多，对你也只有Guest！
你总有防火墙，我始终停不掉！
没有任何奢求只想做你最后的Administrator！

不要试图与蠢人讲道理，它们是不会听得懂的，而且这样是浪费双方的时间以及精力。

一个人总要走陌生的路，看陌生的风景，听陌生的歌，然后在某个不经意的瞬间，你会发现，原本是费劲心机想要忘记的事情真的就那么忘记了。

不经一番寒彻骨，怎得梅花扑鼻香。

这种事情见得多了，我只想说懂得都懂，不懂的我也不多解释，毕竟自己知道就好，细细品吧。你们也别来问我怎么了，利益牵扯太大，说了对你我都没好处，当不知道就行了，其余的我只能说这里面水很深，牵扯到很多东西。详细情况你们自己是很难找的，网上大部分已经删除干净了，所以我只能说懂得都懂。
This kind of thing see many, I just want to say understand all understand, don't understand I also don't explain much, after all oneself know good, careful taste. You also don't come to ask me how, the interest involved too big, said to you I have no benefit, when don't know to go, the rest of me can only say this inside water deep, involve a lot of things. It is difficult to find the detailed information by yourselves. Most of the Internet has been deleted, so I can only say that I understand everything

课前一定要预习
今日事今日毕：
    Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.
心情愉快地去学习。

There was nothing to hold you back except yourself. 除了你自己，谁都不能阻碍你前进的脚步。
