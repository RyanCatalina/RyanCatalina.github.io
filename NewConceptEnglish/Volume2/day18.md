# Lesson 18 He often does this! 他经常干这种事！

The quieter you become, the more you are able to hear.

但一件事每天都去做，坚持十年，必定会发生质变，你将成为你所在领域里的行家。

The limits of your language are the limits of your world.

操千曲而后晓声，观千剑🗡而后识器。

黑客技术学的再好，也无法入侵你的心！
服务器入侵的再多，对你也只有Guest！
你总有防火墙，我始终停不掉！
没有任何奢求只想做你最后的Administrator！

不要试图与蠢人讲道理，它们是不会听得懂的，而且这样是浪费双方的时间以及精力。

一个人总要走陌生的路，看陌生的风景，听陌生的歌，然后在某个不经意的瞬间，你会发现，原本是费劲心机想要忘记的事情真的就那么忘记了。

不经一番寒彻骨，怎得梅花扑鼻香。

这种事情见得多了，我只想说懂得都懂，不懂的我也不多解释，毕竟自己知道就好，细细品吧。你们也别来问我怎么了，利益牵扯太大，说了对你我都没好处，当不知道就行了，其余的我只能说这里面水很深，牵扯到很多东西。详细情况你们自己是很难找的，网上大部分已经删除干净了，所以我只能说懂得都懂。

You also don't come to ask me how, the interest involved too big, said to you I have no benefit, when don't know to go, the rest of me can only say this inside water deep, involve a lot of things. It is difficult to find the detailed information by yourselves. Most of the Internet has been deleted, so I can only say that I understand everything
